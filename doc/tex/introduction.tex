\section{Introduction}

\begin{displayquote}
	Go is an ancient game which, from its forgotten origins in China, spread first
	to the rest of East Asia, and then to the entire world. How ancient? Historians
	aren't sure; it has a definite history of over 3000 years, but according to
	tradition Go was invented more than 4000 years ago. The English name comes from
	the Japanese name Igo, which means ``surrounding boardgame''.

	In this game, each player tries to use threats of death, capture, or isolation
	to assert control over more of the board than his opponent. An abstract strategy
	game at heart, Go has nonetheless been interpreted as a stylized representation
	of fighting a war, settling a frontier, cornering a market, thrashing out an
	argument, or even of fortune-telling and prophecy. Go has always been one of the
	most played games in the world. \parencite{sl_go}
