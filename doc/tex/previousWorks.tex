%\subsection{SGF}
%
%SGF (\textit{Smart Go Format} or, in a more general context, \textit{Smart Game
%Format}) is a text file format specification for records of games or collections
%of them. It was devised for Go but it supports other games with similar
%turn-based structure. It supports move variations, annotations, setups and game
%metadata. By supporting SGF our application can be used to analyse existing
%games registered by other applications, such as those played on online Go
%servers.

\subsection{GTP}

GTP (\textit{Go Text Protocol}) is a text based protocol for communication with
computer go programs. [ref https://www.lysator.liu.se/~gunnar/gtp/] It is the
protocol used by GNU Go and the more modern and powerful KataGo. By supporting
GTP our application can be used with existing GUIs and other programs, making
it easier to use it with the tools users are already familiar with.
